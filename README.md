## Description

This course enables students to manage a dynamic website development
project from start to finish, based on industry level case studies, in
collaboration with a student work team. In some situations, students may
be given the opportunity to work on real industry requests, leading into
potential internships. This course contains the integrating activity of
the program.

## Modality

This course is conducted online synchronously. Team classroom links will
be provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Unfortunately, I am unable to offer office hours. All meetings must take
place during scheduled class time. Outside of class periods, you can
reach me through MIO or Teams at any time. Please allow 24 to 48 hours
for me to respond.

## Pedagogical approach

This course consists exclusively of hands-on lab activities. Students
will meet with the teacher daily to assess the work done, and plan for
the day.

## Assessments

### Learning Integration Assessment

> Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
> attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
> that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

The LIA for this course is a single project completed over the course of
the semester. Grades will be assigned by team, though individual
students may be penalized for insufficient participation.

#### Competency assessed

- EHN2: Create a website

#### Evaluation criteria

- Adequate project planning and monitoring using current methods
- Quality of the design and adaptation of the mock-ups
- Quality, structure and accuracy of the integration and programming of
  animated and interactive interfaces
- Quality of processing and integration of textual and media elements
- Quality, structure and adequate optimization of the site's server
  programming elements
- Accuracy and rigour of validation tests
- Proper optimization of source files
- Proper publishing on a remote server
- Clarity of expression and rationale in the presentation
- Quality of teamwork
- Adequate demonstration of autonomy

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well-written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues. Accordingly, 10% of the total grade for projects
and the LIA will be devoted to the assessment of students' proficiency
in the language of instruction. Variable and function names will be
assessed for consistency and correctness, while comments will be
assessed for accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late submission policy

Due to the nature of the course, late submissions will not be accepted.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.

For more information, refer to [Vanier's official policy] on the
subject.

#### Generative AI

In this course, you may not submit any work generated by an AI program
such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as your own. Doing so constitutes
plagiarism. If there are doubts regarding the provenance of your work,
you may be required to explain and reason through your code.
