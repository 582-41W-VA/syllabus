be given the opportunity to work on real industry requests, leading into
potential internships. This course contains the integrating activity of
the program.

## Assessments

### Learning Integration Assessment

> Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
> attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
> that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

All the assignments for this course are part of the LIA. Grading will be
divided in three phases, each worth 30%, plus a final presentation worth
10%.

#### Evaluation criteria

-   Adequate project planning and monitoring using current methods
-   Quality of the design and adaptation of the mock-ups
-   Quality, structure and accuracy of the integration and programming
    of animated and interactive interfaces
-   Quality of processing and integration of textual and media elements
-   Quality, structure and adequate optimization of the site's server
    programming elements
-   Accuracy and rigour of validation tests
-   Proper optimization of source files
-   Proper publishing on a remote server
-   Clarity of expression and rationale in the presentation
-   Quality of teamwork
-   Adequate demonstration of autonomy

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well-written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues.

Accordingly, 10% of the total grade for projects and the LIA will be
devoted to the assessment of students' proficiency in the language of
instruction. Variable and function names will be assessed for
consistency and correctness, while comments will be assessed for
accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late submission policy

Due to the nature of the assignments, late submissions will not be
accepted in this course. Each phase will be assessed according to what
has been submitted since the last phase.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.
